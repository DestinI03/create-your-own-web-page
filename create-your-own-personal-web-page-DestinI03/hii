<h1>Intro about me</h1>
<p>I am a Sophmore at Erskine College.I like to go and fish whenever I can just to clear my mind its one of the most peaceful things to do when you need time alone. Im planning to start back up playing football I recently tore the muscles around my spinal cord and its been a lot of recovering but I got cleared right before spring season. I am apart of a bowling team back in my hometown called "LGB" which stands for Little Georgia Boys.</p>
        
<h1>Favorite Hobby</h1>
<p>My favorite hobby is bowling because when i was younger i had almost all my birthday's at the bowling alley just because i want to learn how to throw the ball down the lane and watch it knock all the pins down. 
I got older and realized the difference between house balls and pro balls. 
I tured 17 and bought my first pro ball it was a Rhino ball. It was built to go down the lane and curve at the end. 
I had to play with that ball for about 2 years because once i got the ball my footwork was terrible.
I had to find a step rythem that fits my ball which took about 5 months.</p>
